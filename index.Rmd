# Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

## Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

### Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```


### Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


### Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```



# Assignment 
## Instructions
This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertise in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:

1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub.

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document).  

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/). 

5) Write a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document. 



## DyGraph example 

```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>% 
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2) %>%
  dyRangeSelector()

```


## Poudre Paragraph
The Poudre River is a nationally designated [*Wild and Scenic River*](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/arp/recarea/?recid=81605) with headwaters in Rocky Mountain National Park. The river runs through the Poudre Canyon in Roosevelt National Forest, north of Fort Collins, and eastward towards Greely where it flows into the South Platte River. It currently provides extensive **recreational opportunities** as well as water supply for **irrigation**. Since 2009, a 45-mile segment of the river corridor has been protected as a [National Heritage Area](https://www.nps.gov/places/cache-la-poudre-river-national-heritage-area.htm). This designation and the associated development of museums and historical sites was aimed at preserving the importance of the river to Colorado communities throughout history, from the [Northern Arapahoe](https://www.poudreheritage.org/water-legacy/) people to today's urban and agricultural water users.
